It has minimum requirements for nest js app development like authentication and role permissions seeds , users and etc. . \nThis app is built with software as a service principles. You have a owner entity and the owner has multiple users with diffrent roles. owner and owners users can only do actions in their owner data's. Allthough the owner's database is all the same but divided by owner_id.\n\nInstallation\nFor running this app you need latest version of node js and NPM. After installing node run this command on project directory.\n$ npm install\n\n# or \n\n$ yarn installRunning the app\nFirst of all run the following command and config your database options in .env file. You need to specify two dfferent database for test and development enviroment : \ncp .env.example .envThen you can run seed command to build tables and seed some vital data's in order to work with API's.\n$ npm run seed:runIn order to seed datas for test enviroment you can run : \n$ npm run seed:run:TestTo serve the app in diffrent modes run following commands: \n# development\n$ npm run start\n\n# watch mode\n$ npm run start:dev\n\n# production mode\n$ npm run start:prodTest\n# unit tests\n$ npm run test\n\n# e2e tests\n$ npm run test:e2e\n\n# test coverage\n$ npm run test:covDevelopment\nProject structure is Nest js standard: \n.\n├── src\n│ ├── Middlewares\n│ │ ├───── xxxx.middleware.ts\n│ ├── utils\n│ ├── Seeds\n│ ├── Entity_Name\n│ │ ├── Controllers\n│ │ ├───── Entity_Name.controller.ts\n│ │ ├───── Entity_Name.controller.spec.ts?\n│ │ └── Entities\n│ │ ├───── index.ts\n│ │ ├───── Entity_Name.ts?\n│ │ └── permissions\n│ │ ├───── Permissions.ts\n│ │ └── Services\n│ │ ├───── Entity_Name.service.ts\n│ │ ├───── Entity_Name.service.spec.ts?\n│ │ └── types?\n│ │ ├───── type1.ts\n│ │ ├───── type2.ts?\n│ │ └── Entity_Name.module.ts\n│ ├── ...\n└── app.module.ts\n└── test \n│ ├── Entity_Name\n│ │ ├── Entity_Name.e2e.tsTo build a new module, service, controller etc. you can use nest generator.
